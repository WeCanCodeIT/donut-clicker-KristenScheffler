        <h1>Developer's Quick Bio</h1>
        <p>Hello! My name is Kristen Scheffler. I am the developer for this game! I have been in coding school at We Can Code It for about a month now and I am loving it (even though it is quite hard at times) lol. I'm 32 years old and I've lived in Ohio my whole life. I have one 2 year old daughter named Peyton, who is the biggest handful of my life! At the same time, my greatest achievement and love of my life. I really look forward to the future with her. I see us moving to Texas, where my brother lives, and myself coding. Being able to work from home is one of my all time goals, so I am able to stay home with my daughter while also working. Coding will hopefully make that dream come true! Thank you so much for reading my quick Bio!</p>
