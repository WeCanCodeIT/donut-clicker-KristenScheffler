            <p>Hello! My name is Kristen Scheffler, I am the developer for this game. I am currently in coding school at We Can Code It and I am loving it! I have knowledge and expertise of HTML, JavaScript, CSS and Java. I've always wanted to create some sort of game and now here we are! I'm 32 years old and I've lived in Ohio my entire life. I can not wait to see what my coding future holds! Thank you so much for reading my quick Bio!</p>
